When developing a system for a tv in a public room, I decided to display the photographs in this fashion. To share this with the world I made it available for contribution and usage on Github. To make this some sort of achievement I tried to use as much CSS3 and as less jQuery stuff as possible, therefore showing the capabilities of CSS3 and HTML5.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTo use the Shifting Tiles gallery you should clone the repository\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_project_root/lib\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/hermanbanken/shiftingtiles.git shiftingtiles\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and write the following lines to initiate the gallery in the node with id #elem\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script>\r\n\tfunction photoSource(){\r\n\t\treturn \"img.jpg\";\r\n\t}\r\n\t$(\"#elem\").shiftingtiles(photoSource);\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nShifting Tiles was created by @hermanbanken inpired by Apple and enpowered by HTML5 and CSS3.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with shifting tiles? Contact me via Github, @hermanbanken.","name":"Shifting Tiles","google":"","tagline":"Photo gallery based on the Mac OS X Shifting Tiles screensaver"}
